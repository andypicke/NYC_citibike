# NYC_citibike

An analysis of NYC citibike usage data.

*I originally started this analysis in 2017/2018, and discussed some of the results in a series of posts*: 
- (https://andypicke.github.io/Citibike_Part1/)
- (https://andypicke.github.io/Citibike_Part2_EDA/)
- (https://andypicke.github.io/Citibike_Part3_Modeling/)

*I'm currently in the progress of reorganizing some code, making improvements based on what i've learned since then, building out this README, and possibly incorporating newer data. Stay tuned!*
