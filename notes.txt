Could reduce size of monthly files also. We don’t need station lon/lat or addresses for every ride. Can just have station id and separate table with station locations that could merge. That would eliminate 6 columns! There are only a finite number of distinct stations, so station file wouldn’t be very big.


- Maybe separate station info into separate data frame before writing to sql. Keep station ids in ‘rides’ , and make separate table with just station info, and id as primary key
